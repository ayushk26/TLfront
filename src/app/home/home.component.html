                    display. Even today 12 million Indians, the worlds largest blind
                    population, are almost completely dependent on the braille script

                    an input and output device wherein the content can be read and
                    typed. You could insert a USB drive and this Braille device can read
                    the files. You can pair it via Bluetooth to a Smartphone, computer,
                    or tablet. You can also Whatsapp, send emails by typing messages in
                    Braille Me which would then get converted into visual English (or

                      Many of my finest memories as an engineer in the institute were made
                      here. Be it pulling out all-nighters for XLR8, RC Plane or designing
                      a life follower in my freshmen year, every experience is etched very
                      deep in my heart. It’s the closest to a place that allows you to
                      realize that Tinkerer’s image one has in his/her mind before setting
                      afoot at IIT Bombay. I have been privileged enough to get an
                      opportunity to serve as the secretary for Tinkerers’ Lab and I still
                      cherish the feeling of enabling others to realize the Tinkerer
                      within oneself. Tinkerer’s Lab has always played some part in every
                      project be it hobby or academic that I have done. It was always fun
                      to have a lab open 24 hours to work on your ideas and I would say
                      Tinkerers’ lab has played a key role in my journey to becoming an

                      a life follower in my freshmen year, every experience is etched very
                      deep in my heart. It’s the closest to a place that allows you to
                      realize that Tinkerer’s image one has in his/her mind before setting
                      afoot at IIT Bombay. I have been privileged enough to get an
                      opportunity to serve as the secretary for Tinkerers’ Lab and I still
                      cherish the feeling of enabling others to realize the Tinkerer
                      within oneself. Tinkerer’s Lab has always played some part in every
                      project be it hobby or academic that I have done. It was always fun
                      to have a lab open 24 hours to work on your ideas and I would say
                      Tinkerers’ lab has played a key role in my journey to becoming an
                      engineer.
