                become the world’s most affordable, multi-language Digital Braille
                display. Even today 12 million Indians, the worlds largest blind

                perforated on hard paper. Yet, in the modern world, most of the
                resources available are in digital form. Put simply, Braille Me is
                an input and output device wherein the content can be read and
                typed. You could insert a USB drive and this Braille device can read
                the files. You can pair it via Bluetooth to a Smartphone, computer,
                or tablet. You can also Whatsapp, send emails by typing messages in
                Braille Me which would then get converted into visual English (or
                another language) characters. The USP of BrailleMe is its unique
                magnetic operated actuators technology that enables them to offer
                the product at a 10x price advantage over competitors.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="card-footer"> In 2014 when TL had just been set up Deepak Venkat and a team of students had
        begun exploring manufacturing processes, motion mechanization and computer integrated control by
        designing & building machine prototypes at TL from scratch and testing them iteratively to improve them
        further. By 2016 the team had successfully developed a working prototype of square tube profiling
        machine in Tinkerers lab. Today Metalman Automation is a Mumbai based industrial machinery startup
        incubated at SINE IIT Bombay. The company’s machinery and engineering support together gives shop-floors
        the ability to process metal in a way that allows quick completion of projects at a much lower cost.

        subject. It fea-
        tures playing songs alongside the emotion recognition part. As an added bonus, it shows up a cartoonized
        image of yours with your name written on bottom right of screen and displays your emotion. There is also
        an image magick gui alongside the cartoonized image for further editing of the image. The entire

                  Many of my finest memories as an engineer in the institute were made
                  here. Be it pulling out all-nighters for XLR8, RC Plane or designing
                  a life follower in my freshmen year, every experience is etched very
                  deep in my heart. It’s the closest to a place that allows you to
                  realize that Tinkerer’s image one has in his/her mind before setting
                  afoot at IIT Bombay. I have been privileged enough to get an
                  opportunity to serve as the secretary for Tinkerers’ Lab and I still
                  cherish the feeling of enabling others to realize the Tinkerer
                  within oneself. Tinkerer’s Lab has always played some part in every

                  to have a lab open 24 hours to work on your ideas and I would say
                  Tinkerers’ lab has played a key role in my journey to becoming an
